The Airline reservation system is designed for users to reserve a seat, cancel, display seat and exit the system. A formula is included in the function to calculate the seats are reserved. A few flow charts are also created for explaining the process of the Airline reservation system.

A small airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservation system. Here, I am writing a program to assign seats on each flight of the airlines only place (capacity: 15 seats). This program should never assign a seat which is already assigned. If thereâ€™s no seat available, then print the message " the flight is full ".
